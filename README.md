# Cudos Daemon binary packaging

Packages are produced by the code in this repository and published

details on how to install a Cudos node daemon using these binary packages, on a Linux system.

Please be aware that this service is being offered on a "Proof of Concept" basis.

Please see https://github.com/CudoVentures/cudos-noded-packager/blob/main/LICENSE for
the license conditions under which this software is released. 

# Install the repository

## Red Hat family (RHEL, CentOS & Fedora)

NB Every Cudos Node major version has its own repository to maintain separation while
still allowing security and utility upgrades to older versions.

The following is correct for version 0.6.0.

```bash
yum-config-manager --add-repo http://jenkins.gcp.service.cudo.org/cudos/0.6.0/cudos.repo
yum-config-manager --enable cudos-0.6.0
```

If the system doesn't recognise "yum-config-manager" it can be installed using

```bash
dnf install -y yum-utils
```

## Check to ensure the repository can be seen

```bash
dnf repolist --refresh
```

Should look something like

```

# Configure the daemon

This can either be done by hand, the cudos-noded-src package can be installed and the
information can taken directly from the sources

Or by downloading a "Cudos Network Definition" package, which is another rpm/deb package
that contains the relevant genesis and node addresses files for the given network.

The CUDOS_HOME variable is preset to /var/lib/cudos/cudos-data, which is owned by the
user "cudos" who's home directory is /var/lib/cudos.

It is advised that all configuration editing operations be done as user "cudos" in
order to avoid permissions issues. Everything under /var/lib/cudos should be owned by user "cudos"

# Enable and start the daemon

```bash
systemctl enable --now cudos-noded
```

The output should look like

```
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/cudos-noded.service â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/cudos-noded.service.
```

# Logs

As this daemon is controlled by systemd, the logs will natural flow to journald and can be watched using

```bash
journalctl -f -t cudos-noded
```
